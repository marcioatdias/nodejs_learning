# WEBSOCKETS

In this adventure, write some browser code that uses the websocket-stream moduleto print the string "hello\n".
Your solution file will be compiled with browserify and the verify script willprompt you to open `http://localhost:8099` in a browser to verify your solution.To open a stream with websocket-stream on localhost:8099, just write:
    var ws = require('websocket-stream');
    var stream = ws('ws://localhost:8099');
   
Then write the string "hello\n" to the stream.
The readme for websocket-stream has more info if you're curious about how towrite the server side code: https://github.com/maxogden/websocket-stream
Make sure to `npm install websocket-stream` in the directory where your solutionfile lives.
