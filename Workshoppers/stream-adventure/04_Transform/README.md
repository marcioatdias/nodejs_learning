# TRANSFORM

Convert data from `process.stdin` to upper-case data on `process.stdout`
using the `through2` module.

To get the `through2` module you'll need to do:

    npm install through2

A transform stream takes input data and applies an operation to the data to
produce the output data.

Create a through stream with a `write` and `end` function:

    var through = require('through2');
    var stream = through(write, end);

The `write` function is called for every buffer of available input:

    function write (buffer, encoding, next) {
        // ...
    }

and the `end` function is called when there is no more data:

    function end () {
        // ...
    }

Inside the write function, call `this.push()` to produce output data and call
`next()` when you're ready to receive the next chunk:

    function write (buffer, encoding, next) {
        this.push('I got some data: ' + buffer + '\n');
        next();
    }

and call `done()` to finish the output:

    function end (done) {
        done();
    }

`write` and `end` are both optional.

If `write` is not specified, the default implementation passes the input data to
the output unmodified.

If `end` is not specified, the default implementation calls `this.push(null)`
to close the output side when the input side ends.

Make sure to pipe `process.stdin` into your transform stream
and pipe your transform stream into `process.stdout`, like this:

    process.stdin.pipe(tr).pipe(process.stdout);

To convert a buffer to a string, call `buffer.toString()`.
