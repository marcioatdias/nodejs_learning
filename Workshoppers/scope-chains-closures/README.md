# Scope Chains And Closures Workshop

Scope, Scope Chains, Closures, and Garbage Collection all have one thing in
common: They're often hand-waved away. How do closures actually work? When does
Garbage Collection occur? What really IS a Scope Chain?

In this workshop, we will discover it's not black magic after all; No hand
waving is required to explain these language features, in fact you've been using
them all along without realising.
